# Simple Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple image classification task using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras. The goal of this project is to classify images into different categories using a small dataset of hand-written digits (MNIST). This serves as a foundational step in computer vision tasks, providing insights into model architecture and the training process.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- OpenCV (if used)
